## Reporting Issues

A great way to contribute to the project
is to send a detailed issue when you encounter an problem.
I always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too."
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

When reporting issues, please include the following:

* The version of Xcode you're using
* The version of iOS or OS X you're targeting
* The full output of the command
* An archive of the resultBundlePath
* Any other details that would be useful in understanding the problem

This information will help  review and fix your issue faster.
